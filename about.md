I'm Scott Pettit, director and technical lead at [End 2 End](https://www.end2end.co.nz) and [Vorco](https://www.vorco.net). My background started as a nightmare child that couldn't stop dismantling everything in sight and trying to figure out how it worked and how to put it back together again. At high school I started doing small IT jobs for people kind enough to let a kid near their business and eventually while I was at the University of Auckland studying towards my BCom (Management & Information Systems) End 2 End was created, focussed entirely on Cisco routing and voice.

Eventually I met Thomas Jelley and discovered he could do Microsoft "stuff" and needed Cisco help, and I could do Cisco "stuff" and needed Microsoft help so we contracted each other to fill in our respective skills gaps on bigger jobs and eventually he joined End 2 End and we became a real company.

Vorco came a little later on. I'd always dreamed of setting up an telco, but had never been able to justify it; one of my rules is if we can't add value we don't do it. One day End 2 End's incumbent telco really annoyed us to the point I decided even though telecommunications is viciously competitive, we could do it better ourselves.

At this point David Broome, one of our first employees at End 2 End, started work on building a BSS/OSS (billing & operations support) system from scratch for us because if we were going to be able to add value, an off the shelf system wasn't going to give us any flexibility to add value. David also joined as a director and shareholder in Vorco.

Loads more has happened since and here we are today.
